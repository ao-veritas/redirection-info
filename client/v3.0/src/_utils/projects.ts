This tool provides a straightforward way to monitor and verify burned tokens, ensuring transparency and ease of access for users and applications. By querying the CoinBurner interface, users can quickly determine the total amount of tokens burned for a specific asset by simply providing the contract address. This eliminates the need to sift through extensive transaction histories, saving time and simplifying the process. While CoinBurner focuses primarily on tracking and querying burned tokens, it also offers a minimalistic frontend for burning tokens directly by sending them to the burn address.",
